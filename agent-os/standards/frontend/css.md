## CSS best practices

- **Consistent Methodology**: Apply and stick to the project's consistent CSS methodology (Tailwind, BEM, utility classes, CSS modules, etc.) across the entire project
- **Avoid Overriding Framework Styles**: Work with your framework's patterns rather than fighting against them with excessive overrides
- **Maintain Design System**: Establish and document design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) for consistency
- **Minimize Custom CSS**: Leverage framework utilities and components to reduce custom CSS maintenance burden
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimize for production with CSS purging/tree-shaking to remove unused styles

## Aesthetic Excellence

For comprehensive guidance on creating distinctive, memorable designs that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics, see:

**[Frontend Aesthetics & Design Philosophy](./aesthetics.md)**

Key principles:
- **Typography**: Choose unique, beautiful fonts (avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial defaults)
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to cohesive aesthetics with dominant colors and sharp accents
- **Motion**: Use animations strategically for high-impact moments and micro-interactions
- **Backgrounds**: Create atmospheric depth with gradients, patterns, and contextual effects
- **Context-Specific Design**: Tailor aesthetic choices to project purpose and audience
