name: Frontend Accessibility
description: Build accessible user interfaces using semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and proper color contrast. Use this skill when creating or modifying UI components, implementing forms and interactive elements, working with navigation menus, building modals and dialogs, adding images and media content, writing JSX/HTML markup, ensuring keyboard accessibility, testing with screen readers, managing focus states, implementing proper heading hierarchies, providing alternative text for images, maintaining color contrast ratios, using ARIA labels and roles, or ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable. Apply this skill when building frontend components, reviewing UI accessibility, refactoring markup for better semantics, or implementing WCAG compliance requirements.
