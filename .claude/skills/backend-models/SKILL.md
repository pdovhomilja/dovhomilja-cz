name: Backend Models
description: Define and structure database models with proper naming conventions, data integrity constraints, and relationship definitions. Use this skill when creating or modifying database model files, defining table schemas, setting up model relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one), working with ORM model files (schema.prisma, models/*, app/models/*, entities/*), implementing data validation at the model level, adding timestamps and audit fields, defining foreign keys and indexes, choosing appropriate data types, configuring cascade behaviors, or balancing database normalization with query performance. Apply this skill when designing database schemas, creating new models, refactoring existing model structures, or reviewing data integrity and relationship configurations.

# Backend Models

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying database model files (e.g., `schema.prisma`, `models/*`, `app/models/*`, `entities/*`)
- When defining table schemas and column data types
- When setting up model relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one)
- When adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys, check constraints)
- When implementing timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) and audit fields
- When choosing appropriate data types for columns based on data requirements
- When adding indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- When defining validation rules at the model or database level
- When configuring cascade behaviors for relationships (CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT)
- When balancing database normalization with practical query performance needs
- When naming models following singular/plural conventions
- When reviewing data integrity and relationship definitions

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.
