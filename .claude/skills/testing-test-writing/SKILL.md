name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write minimal, strategic tests focused on core user flows and critical paths during feature development, deferring comprehensive edge case testing. Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests, creating test files (*.test.ts, *.spec.js, __tests__/*), testing critical user workflows, focusing on behavior rather than implementation details, using descriptive test names, mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems), ensuring tests run quickly, testing business-critical functionality, or determining which tests to write during development versus dedicated testing phases. Apply this skill when completing features at logical milestones, writing tests for primary user flows, or balancing feature development speed with adequate test coverage.

# Testing Test Writing

## When to use this skill

- When writing test files (e.g., `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.js`, `*.test.jsx`, `__tests__/*`)
- When creating unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests
- When testing core user flows and critical business paths
- When testing behavior rather than implementation details
- When using descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems)
- When ensuring tests run quickly (milliseconds for unit tests)
- When determining which tests to write during feature development
- When focusing on business-critical functionality first
- When reaching logical completion points in feature development
- When deferring edge case and validation testing to dedicated phases
- When balancing test coverage with development velocity

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.
