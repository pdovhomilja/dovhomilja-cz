name: Global Coding Style
description: Write clean, consistent code following established naming conventions, formatting rules, and the DRY principle across all files. Use this skill when writing any code in any file, naming variables and functions, structuring code logic, formatting code with consistent indentation, choosing descriptive names that reveal intent, keeping functions small and focused, removing dead code and unused imports, extracting common logic into reusable functions, maintaining consistent code style across the codebase, configuring linters and formatters, or refactoring code for better readability. Apply this skill universally across all coding tasks to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency with project standards. This skill should be active for all file types including TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, and other programming languages.

# Global Coding Style

## When to use this skill

- When writing or modifying any code file (*.ts, *.js, *.tsx, *.jsx, *.py, *.rb, *.java, *.go, etc.)
- When naming variables, functions, classes, or files
- When structuring code logic and organizing functions
- When formatting code with proper indentation and line breaks
- When choosing descriptive names that clearly reveal intent
- When keeping functions small and focused on a single task
- When removing dead code, commented-out blocks, or unused imports
- When extracting common logic to avoid duplication (DRY principle)
- When configuring or using linters and formatters (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
- When refactoring code for better readability and maintainability
- When reviewing code for consistency with team conventions
- When deciding whether backward compatibility logic is needed

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global coding style.
