name: Frontend Components
description: Design and build reusable, composable UI components following single responsibility principle with clear interfaces and proper state management. Use this skill when creating React components, Vue components, or other framework components, defining component props and interfaces, managing component state, building reusable UI elements, working with component files (*.tsx, *.jsx, *.vue, *.svelte, components/*, ui/*), implementing component composition patterns, encapsulating component logic, documenting component APIs, keeping state local or lifting it up when needed, designing component hierarchies, or refactoring monolithic components into smaller pieces. Apply this skill when building new components, refactoring existing component structures, reviewing component design patterns, or ensuring components are maintainable and reusable.

# Frontend Components

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying component files (e.g., `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `components/*`, `ui/*`)
- When designing new UI components or refactoring existing ones
- When defining component props, interfaces, or type definitions
- When managing component state (useState, useReducer, reactive state, etc.)
- When implementing component composition (combining smaller components into larger ones)
- When building reusable UI elements that can be used across different contexts
- When encapsulating component logic and keeping implementation details private
- When documenting component usage, props, and providing examples
- When deciding whether to keep state local or lift it up to parent components
- When splitting large, complex components into smaller, focused ones
- When naming components with clear, descriptive names
- When reviewing component architecture for maintainability and reusability

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend components.
