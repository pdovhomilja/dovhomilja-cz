name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles with clear resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods. Use this skill when creating API routes, defining API endpoints, implementing HTTP request handlers, working on route files (routes.ts, route.ts, api/*, controllers/*, handlers/*), building REST APIs, designing API versioning strategies, setting up query parameters for filtering and pagination, implementing rate limiting, or returning appropriate HTTP status codes. Apply this skill when structuring backend API architecture, creating new API endpoints, refactoring existing endpoints, or reviewing API design for consistency and best practices.

# Backend API

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying API route files (e.g., `app/api/*/route.ts`, `pages/api/*.ts`, `routes/*.ts`, `controllers/*.ts`)
- When designing new API endpoints or refactoring existing endpoint structures
- When implementing HTTP request handlers (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- When setting up RESTful resource-based URL patterns
- When adding versioning to your API (URL path or header-based)
- When implementing query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination, or search
- When defining HTTP status codes for API responses
- When adding rate limiting headers or functionality to API endpoints
- When reviewing API architecture for consistency with REST principles
- When working with nested resource endpoints
- When structuring API error responses and success responses

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.
