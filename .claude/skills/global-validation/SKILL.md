name: Global Validation
description: Implement comprehensive input validation on both client and server sides with clear error messages, type checking, and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities. Use this skill when validating user input, implementing form validation, checking data types and formats, sanitizing input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection), validating business rules, providing field-specific error messages, implementing server-side validation for all entry points (API endpoints, web forms, background jobs), using client-side validation for immediate user feedback, applying allowlists over blocklists, validating ranges and required fields, or ensuring consistent validation across the application. Apply this skill when handling any user input, building forms, creating API endpoints, or reviewing code for security and data integrity.

# Global Validation

## When to use this skill

- When validating user input in forms, API endpoints, or any entry point
- When implementing form validation (client-side and server-side)
- When checking data types, formats, and ranges
- When sanitizing input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- When validating business rules and constraints
- When providing clear, field-specific error messages to users
- When implementing server-side validation (always required for security)
- When using client-side validation for immediate user feedback
- When applying allowlists to define what is allowed rather than blocklists
- When validating required fields and mandatory data
- When ensuring consistent validation across all entry points
- When reviewing code for validation completeness and security

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global validation.
