name: Frontend CSS
description: Write and maintain CSS following project conventions using consistent methodologies like Tailwind CSS, BEM, CSS modules, or utility classes, while creating distinctive, aesthetically excellent designs. Use this skill when writing CSS styles, applying Tailwind utility classes, creating custom CSS, working with styling files (*.css, *.scss, *.module.css, globals.css, tailwind.config.*), maintaining design systems and design tokens, defining CSS variables for colors and spacing, implementing typography styles with unique font choices, creating atmospheric backgrounds and depth, adding animations and micro-interactions, avoiding framework style overrides, avoiding generic "AI slop" aesthetics (purple gradients, Inter/Roboto everywhere, cookie-cutter designs), optimizing CSS for production with purging and tree-shaking, or ensuring consistent styling patterns across the application. Apply this skill when styling components, refactoring CSS code, setting up design systems, choosing fonts and colors, creating animations, or reviewing styling approaches for consistency, maintainability, and aesthetic excellence.
