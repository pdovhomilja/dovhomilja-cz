name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, specific exception types, centralized error boundaries, and graceful degradation strategies. Use this skill when writing try-catch blocks, handling exceptions and errors, creating error messages for users, implementing error boundaries in React or other frameworks, validating input and checking preconditions, handling API errors and external service failures, implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff, cleaning up resources in finally blocks, designing graceful degradation for non-critical failures, or preventing technical details and security information from being exposed to users. Apply this skill when handling errors in any code file, implementing error recovery mechanisms, or reviewing error handling approaches for robustness and security.

# Global Error Handling

## When to use this skill

- When writing try-catch blocks or error handling logic in any file
- When handling exceptions and errors from external services or APIs
- When creating error messages that will be displayed to users
- When implementing error boundaries in React or similar frameworks
- When validating input and checking preconditions early in functions
- When using specific exception or error types instead of generic ones
- When implementing centralized error handling at API or controller boundaries
- When designing graceful degradation for non-critical service failures
- When implementing retry strategies with exponential backoff
- When cleaning up resources (connections, file handles) in finally blocks
- When ensuring error messages don't expose technical details or security information
- When reviewing error handling for completeness and security

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global error handling.
