name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code with minimal, helpful comments that explain large sections of logic without cluttering the codebase. Use this skill when writing code comments, documenting complex logic, reviewing whether comments are needed, writing function documentation, explaining non-obvious code sections, ensuring code clarity through naming and structure, avoiding temporary or change-related comments, keeping comments evergreen and future-relevant, or deciding between adding comments versus refactoring for clarity. Apply this skill when writing or reviewing any code file to ensure comments add value without creating noise, and that code is primarily self-explanatory through clear naming and structure.
